          <p> To me, programming is all about critical thinking. One has to open his
            mind to learn what is applicable. It is as vast as an Ocean..its learners
            overwhelmed by the tides it presents. A warm skill not for the feeble
            minds. It requires patience, observation and smart reasoning.... making
            its learners feel unique and strong. I'm proud to be one!...I'll always
            be a renowned great programmer.
